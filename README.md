# Xenophyre
A 1.12.2 Minecraft Utility Mod for Anarchy servers!

## Stuff
Some things to note are that this client is in early development, and most features do not work yet. I update this project quite frequently, and if you have any issues make an issue, and add me on discord to discuss the problem.

## Credits
SrgantMoomoo for most of the base
Lemon Click GUI

## Things to note
Some code is borrowed for modules that I don't want to mess with rn, but most of it is original code by me. Eventually I will remove older code when I get around to it, but Just know that I juggle Work, School, and irl relationships while developing this client, so plz be patient.

## FUTURE
Well, it appears that most anarchy servers are preparing to update to 1.16 since it turns out that it is now possible for 1.16 possibilities. Due to that... I will probably halt development on Xenophyre and put efforts into devloping a fabric client for 1.16. That doesn't mean this project is over, it just means that there won't be as many updates. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
