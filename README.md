# Xenophyre
A 1.12.2 Minecraft Utility Mod for Anarchy servers!

## Stuff
Some things to note are that this client is in early development, and most features do not work yet. I update this project quite frequently, and if you have any issues make an issue, and add me on discord to discuss the problem.

## Credits
SrgantMoomoo for most of the base
Lemon Click GUI

## Things to note
Some code is borrowed for modules that I don't want to mess with rn, but most of it is original code by me. Eventually I will remove older code when I get around to it, but Just know that I juggle Work, School, and irl relationships while developing this client, so plz be patient.
